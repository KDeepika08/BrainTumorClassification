# BrainTumorClassification

• Collaborated in a team to design and implement an inventive machine learning solution for accurately classifying brain tumors from MRI images.\
• Engineered a machine learning model employing SVM, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost, while also conducting preprocessing of the MRI data to improve the model's performance and mitigate overfitting.\
• Conducted a comprehensive evaluation of model performance using various metrics, followed by hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's accuracy.\
• Leveraged various data visualization techniques to effectively communicate model results to both team members and stakeholders.\
• Proficiently worked with Tkinter to navigate the frontend interface designed using Gradio.
